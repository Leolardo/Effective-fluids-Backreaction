# Effective_fluids-Backreaction

This Repo contains a Jupiter Notebook that integrates the field equation of the Cosmological Model proposed in [2410.15295](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15295).
It uses a bunch of standard python packages for Astronomy, and requires the Boltzmann Solver [CLASS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2932).
I hope you have fun with it, and if you have trouble in using/understanding anything, feel free to reach out.  I am happy to help!
